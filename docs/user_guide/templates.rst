Premade Templates
=================

There are various other premade project templates than just the 
minimal we discussed to help you get started. Choose a template
that suits the complexity of your project.

To create a project from given template (in this case `simple`):

.. code-block:: console

   python -m redengine create myproject --template simple

List of Templates
-----------------

- ``standalone``: The most simplistic example. Only one file system.
- ``simple``: Has most of the features offered by Red Engine but not more.
  Useful to get familiar with the framework or for moderate sized projects.
